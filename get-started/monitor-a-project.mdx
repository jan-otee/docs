Once your project is applied to a device and executing on it, you will be able to observe the data produced by the runtime through the Tag Browser.

On the right-hand edge of your screen, click on “Tag Browser” to expand it. This will give you a window to explore the tags in your project’s namespace, sorted in hierarchical order and broken down into your project’s POUs.

  alt="Tag Browser Dark"
/>

The tag browser can also be used to not only consume, but to set values as well. To do so, click on the value you’d like to override, enter the desired value and confirm the dialog.

## Monitor live tag values in code

Hit the goggles symbol on top of your tag editor to display live tag values not only in the tag browser (as shown above) but in-line with the code where the variable is used.
