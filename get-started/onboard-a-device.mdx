<Tip>

System requirements for devices hosting OTee vPLCs: 

* Linux OS

* Internet connection and open 7422 port (outbound)

* Sufficient CPU and memory to support the intended control logic and cycle times (for small projects, pretty much any machine will do!)

* CURL and tar installed on the OS

* Docker and ‘docker compose’ (v2 or higher) installed on the OS (see next info box below)

* Current user needs to be part of the Docker user group (or use sudo)

To add your own user to the Docker user group, run this command:

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
// now logout and login.
```

Optional:

* Ethernet port (for connecting to remote I/O)

* The following chip architectures of target devices are currently supported:

* ARM32, ARM64, x86_64
