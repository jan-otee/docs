You can sign up and log in to OTee’s Industrial IoT Platform through app.otee.io/login. If you don’t have an existing account, click the “Don’t have an account? Sign up” link in the dialog. Here, you’ll be able to set a secure email and password combination for yourself, or simply connect your Google or Microsoft work account.
