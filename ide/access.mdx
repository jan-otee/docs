You can sign up and log in to OTee’s Industrial IoT Platform through app.otee.io/login. If you don’t have an existing account, click the “Don’t have an account? Sign up” link in the dialog. Here, you’ll be able to set a secure email and password combination for yourself, or simply connect your Google or Microsoft work account.

From now on, projects that you create using this account will, by default, not be shared with anyone else. Should you at a later point in time wish to collaborate with more members of your organization, your OTee support team will assist you in setting up the organization for you with the correct accessibility and security configuration.

## Getting Help

If you have forgotten your password, you can safely reset it following the “Forgot password?” link in the log-in form. Note that this method will only work if you’re using an email address and password to log in, but not when you’re using social sign-on through Google or Microsoft.

Once inside the platform, chat with an OTee engineer directly for support - also, use the feedback widget to help us make the product continuously better.
