## Project Browser

The Project Browser on the left-hand side lets you create and access your various program organization units (POUs) in your project. 

POUs are categorized for easy access. Hit the little arrow next to a category to expand or collapse its content.

Selecting a POU in the navigation pane will load its content into the code window for editing.
