The software model for PLCs, as defined in the IEC 61131-3 standard, consists of, at the top level, a configuration. The configuration defines the hardware structure and logic of the PLC system and contains resources, which are able to execute programs. These resources are controlled by tasks, which invoke the execution of Program Organization Units (POUs).
