In the top bar of your project browser pane, press the “Create an entity” button. Select “Driver configuration” from the drop-down menu in the “Type” field, then select “MODBUS” from the drop-down menu in the “Driver” field. This will create a Modbus node in your project browser tree. Select the node to access the driver configuration.

## Modbus TCP

The configuration happens in two steps, where the first one is the client configuration itself, and the second one is the Modbus request configuration. You can create one or multiple clients, and within each client you can create one or multiple requests.

As you set up your requests (click on a request to expand or collapse it), you can map Modbus memory addresses to your own, user-defined symbols via the “Driver symbols” table for better readability and practical re-use throughout your project. In practice, when you assign a memory address to tags in your POUs or global variables, you will now be able to select the according symbols rather than working with the rather cryptic memory addresses directly.
