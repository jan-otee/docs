So far, your project only lives as code in the cloud. Let's change that and execute it on your local edge device.

## Create a New Project

Switch to the Projects tab in the app’s main navigation. Here, you’ll see a list of existing projects within your organization to which you have at least viewing permission. To create a new project from scratch, hit the “(+) Create a Project” button and give it a name. This will take you to the editor - your main user interface for programming, managing and deploying control logic to your virtual PLC (vPLC). Projects created in OTee adhere to the software model as described in the international IEC 61131-3 standard for PLC programming.

Note that by default, your new project is not associated with any target device or virtual PLC - it exists only as code in the cloud, with no runtime connected to it. Check the Virtual PLC section of this user documentation to master the initial setup of a new device and its configuration.

<Info>

Currently, the Editor supports Structured Text (ST) only. It does not yet support other programming languages included in IEC 61131-3.

## Export and Import a Project

OTee is all about openness, so any code produced on the platform can be exported for further processing in any IEC 61131 compliant application. When inside a project, use the Export menu entry in the project settings on top of the project browser. Alternatively, use the action menu from the project list view and choose "Export". This will create and download an XML file to your hard drive named after your project. In turn, to import such an XML project file, you will need to navigate to your project overview: Switch to the Project tab in the app's main navigation, then click the <Icon icon="download" iconType="solid" /> "Import a Project" button and select the file from your hard drive. This will create a new project, populated with the contents of the XML project file.

<Info>

The import function works currently best on OTee-exported projects. This is work in progress and the aim is to support the import of all IEC 61131 compliant projects.
