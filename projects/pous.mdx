description: "IEC 61131 Program Organization Units."

Projects created in OTee adhere to the software model as described in the international IEC 61131-3 standard for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Essential building blocks that together make a PLC project are program organization units, or POUs. The different types of POUs are functions, function blocks, and programs. 

## Functions

A function can be thought of as a subprogram (often an equation) that has no internal memory, so it returns a value rather than an output. This means that any time a function is invoked, if the same inputs are used, the same value will be returned, regardless of the number of times the function is used.

Below is a simple example of a function defined in the Code Editor, together with the according variables and return type defined in the Tag Editor.

```javascript lines
difference := minuend - subtrahend;

IF difference < 0 THEN
    ResultIsNegative := TRUE;
ELSE
    ResultIsNegative := FALSE;
END_IF;

CalcDifference := difference;
```

<Info>

The name of the function POU (as it appears in your project browser on the left-hand side of the screen) must be the same as the return statement inside the code, in this example “CalcDifference”.
