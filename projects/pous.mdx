Projects created in OTee adhere to the software model as described in the international IEC 61131-3 standard for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Essential building blocks that together make a PLC project are program organization units, or POUs. The different types of POUs are functions, function blocks, and programs. 

## Functions

A function can be thought of as a subprogram (often an equation) that has no internal memory, so it returns a value rather than an output. This means that any time a function is invoked, if the same inputs are used, the same value will be returned, regardless of the number of times the function is used.

Below is a simple example of a function defined in the Code Editor, together with the according variables and return type defined in the Tag Editor.

```javascript lines
difference := minuend - subtrahend;

IF difference < 0 THEN
    ResultIsNegative := TRUE;
ELSE
    ResultIsNegative := FALSE;
END_IF;

CalcDifference := difference;
```

<Info>

The name of the function POU (as it appears in your project browser on the left-hand side of the screen) must be the same as the return statement inside the code, in this example “CalcDifference”.

</Info>

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mx-auto"
  src="/images/function-tags-light.png"
  alt="Function Tags Light"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block mx-auto"
  src="/images/function-tags-dark.png"
  alt="Function Tags Dark"
/>

When calling the function from your program, you can assign the return value directly to a variable, but you can also make use of other output values as defined in your function:

```javascript lines
diff := CalcDifference(
    minuend := 5,
    subtrahend := 42,
    ResultIsNegative => myBoolVar
);
```

## Function Blocks

Function blocks are segments of reusable code that have internal memory and can return different outputs even when the same inputs are used. In other words, the results of a function block are conditional on the previous output of the function block or the current state of the process.

Below is a simple and shortened example of a function block defined in the Code Editor, together with the according variables defined in the Tag Editort.

```javascript lines
IF interlocks > 0 THEN
  interlocked := TRUE;
END_IF;

IF commands.HMI_set_manual THEN
  status.mode_manual := TRUE;
  status.mode_program := FALSE;
END_IF;
```

<Info>
Note that in this example, “status” and “commands” are a custom structure data types. The code snippet is only an illustration of function block syntax.
</Info>

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mx-auto"
  src="/images/function-block-tags-light.png"
  alt="FB Tag Editor Light"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block mx-auto"
  src="/images/function-block-tags-dark.png"
  alt="FB Tag Editor Dark"
/>

To call a function block from within another POU (e.g. in your main program), you’ll have to create a variable (in this example, FB_instance) and select your function block as a data type. Then, start typing “FB_instance” in the Code Editor and refer to the auto-complete suggestions to either call or refer to the instance of your function block:

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mx-auto"
  src="/images/call-function-block-1-light.png"
  alt="Call FB 1 Light"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block mx-auto"
  src="/images/call-function-block-1-dark.png"
  alt="Call FB 1 Dark"
/>

Calling the function block will list all available inputs and outputs for you to link to other variables or enter values directly:

<img
  className="block dark:hidden mx-auto"
  src="/images/call-function-block-2-light-light.png"
  alt="Call FB 2 Light"
  width="300"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block mx-auto"
  src="/images/call-function-block-2-dark.png"
  alt="Call FB 2 Dark"
  width="300"
/>
